Here's the transcript for the provided video.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
-00:12) 

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,200
This is Kim Ou-joon from Wolmal.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Fashion!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
Kim Chul-su, Kim Chul-su.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,200
Pastor Kim from Fashion Gaecheok Church.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Wolmal Kim Ou-joon instead.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Amen!

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No, something like that happened. I received calls from two chairmen of large fashion companies who said they heard about the Dior segment.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,200
People who could be called chairmen?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes, because their sales exceed 1 trillion won.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,600
They said they listened to it well. They said it was interesting.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Chairman.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:20,600
I think they listened to it on YouTube. I actually went to consult with a certain company, and the chairman told me to come and see him for a moment. Suddenly, he started talking about Kim Chul-su. He said he listens to Dasveida. He's someone who always says he's a hardcore conservative. I was actually a little surprised that he said that.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,200
Are you trying to report him?

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:59,800
No. But he said to me, "Mr. Kim, I live in Seocho, right? Hmm? I'm a third-generation wealthy person and my assets are hundreds of billions. I have several companies, right? But people living in Seocho have a very biased perception. Yes, I know. I know you think I'm a hardcore conservative, but, hmm? I actually hate being too much of a hardcore conservative, so I started listening to Dasveida by Kim Ou-joon to gain some balance. But while listening to it, at the end, I heard a familiar voice."

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Haha.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:21,600
He asked me, "You talked about the Dior segment, right?" and he said, "Man, that Shamanism part was so interesting," and he kept talking and said he would continue to listen carefully.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Chairman, it only costs 10,000 won a month.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:31,800
That's right. For all the employees, if they do the whole thing, would there be a 10% discount for bulk purchases or something like that?

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,200
No, a premium for the chairman.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,200
A premium? Do I have to pay a premium? Usually, they give me an acquaintance discount.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
In my opinion, we should sell one company ID for a thousand people.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
Everyone listens to it.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,400
That's good. Someone like the chairman should do that. Where does the chairman live?

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That place that was flooded. Yes, well, anyway.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Then I should make a comment for the chairman. Chairman, we will create a company ID. Please contact us.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I was really surprised. He even knew about making a statistics company and he was commenting on it. Among people who say they're hardcore conservatives, there are more open-minded people than you'd think.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That person isn't a hardcore conservative. The fact that he thinks his world is so biased already means he's not a hardcore conservative.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I guess so.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Chairman! I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,200
Well, where are we going today?

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,800
We talked about Chanel, Dior, and Saint Laurent, didn't we? Today, let's go to Italy.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
Oh, there are many in Italy.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:04:08,000
When people talk about Italy, they often talk about Prada or Gucci, but much earlier than them, between World War I and II, there was a legendary designer. When talking about Saint Laurent, Saint Laurent's boyfriend wrote something. Great designers like Balenciaga or Schiaparelli might have climbed to the temple of aesthetics, but they couldn't move society. Today, we're going to talk about a designer named Schiaparelli. To evaluate this person as just being aesthetic, he was a designer who approached clothes with a sensitive perspective on society.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,400
Is this person Italian?

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,200
Yes, an Italian person. From Rome.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,600
It seems like it left a mark on my brain cells somewhere.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:38,800
The movie "The Martian." There was a movie where someone falls on Mars and grows crops. The male protagonist, while driving a car that can travel on the surface of Mars, says something like "I'm passing through the Schiaparelli crater."

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
Did I hear it then?

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:53,800
The person who discovered the Schiaparelli crater was Schiaparelli's great-uncle. It's a very intellectual family. Or maybe you heard it because of Elsa. It's Elsa Schiaparelli. I wonder if you thought of Elsa from Frozen.

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,400
I didn't know Elsa was attached to the front.

46
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:59,600
I see. Well, anyway. But fashion people often hear about this person while studying costume history, which is a special history. Oh, Schiaparelli is close friends with a painter named Salvador Dali.

47
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It came to me. Yes. That shrimp, lobster.

48
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
That's right. Oh, you know that. Yes.

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
He drew a lobster on a dress.

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes, yes.

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Edward VIII.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes, that's right.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
His wife.

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes, yes.

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,600
His wife, what was it? Wallis Simpson.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,200
Wallis Simpson. Duchess of Windsor. Yes.

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,400
That's all I know.

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,800
Oh, that's a lot. An American divorcee went to England.

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's right.

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,600
And fell in love with a prince.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes.

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,800
He wore that dress then.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,200
Marriage of the century, something something.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,600
Yes. The man gave up his throne.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes, yes.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,600
That's because he was a bit lacking.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:55,600
Is that so? People call it the romance of the century, but if you look closely, that prince was a bit lacking.

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh.

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes, that's right.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Duchess of Windsor. He was a playboy. He's like the 20th-century version of Prince Harry and the woman who married him and left the British royal family, what was her name? Meghan Markle.

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Meghan Markle, yes.

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,800
But while selecting Schiaparelli, I was a little worried. Even if I talk about someone people recognize, it's not enough...

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Exactly.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,400
This person has been forgotten since World War II.

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,800
He was forgotten for a while but has been restored. The brand is active again.

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, really?

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,800
Yes. But why did I bring this up? This person's life itself is shocking. Really.

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,400
Really? I like shocking.

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,200
He was someone comparable to Prada. There was an exhibition about this person in the US. It compared Prada and Schiaparelli.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,400
Aren't their eras different?

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:15,200
Yes. Because their eras are different, the title of the exhibition was "Impossible Conversation," meaning a dialogue between two people who could never meet. The clothes of the two people were very similar. Morphologically, they are very similar and look alike.

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,200
Schiaparelli sounds like a food name.

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,400
You must be hungry. Since the "D" is long, let's call it "Schiap." Between Schiap and Prada, there was an exhibition comparing the two?

84
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,200
Yes, it was a hot exhibition. While comparing the two, Schiaparelli's clothes look like Prada's, and Prada's clothes look like Schiaparelli's.

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh.

86
00:07:39,000 --> 00:08:11,400
There is a spiritual overlap. Schiaparelli was someone who fought against fascism. And he also went head-to-head with Stalin. The 1930s was a period full of despair and depression. After the Great Depression, the Spanish Civil War broke out, and it was a dark time historically. In that era, he always kept in mind whether fashion could give people some laughter and hope, joy, and so on, and made clothes. And Prada was surprisingly a doctor of political science.

87
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, really?

88
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,200
Yes. And he was a deputy leader of the Communist Party.

89
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I knew that.

90
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:34,600
Prada left many sharp and penetrating remarks about political issues, especially in the 1980s. It was the conservative era, right? It was the era of President Reagan.

91
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I like Prada.

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:46,600
Because of those aspects, I thought it would be interesting to talk about Schiaparelli as a sort of prequel to introduce Prada.

93
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,800
The part I like about Prada is that there's a Prada factory outlet near Florence.

94
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh, there is.

95
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Among factory outlets, this one is the best.

96
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Just for that?

97
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,400
They have the most stuff at the factory outlet.

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,400
It was satisfying. I expected a cool mention, but then let's do Schiaparelli this time and Prada next time?

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,600
Oh, Prada is good. Yes, it's good.

100
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,400
For your information, to go there, you can take a taxi from Florence Station.

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Haha.

102
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,800
Or you can rent a car. I sent a car from Prada, on that condition.

103
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I see.

104
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:41,200
I rented a car at Lyon station in France and drove from there. I'll search all the outlets in southern Italy.

105
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're amazing.

106
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's fun.

107
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,600
That's also a great pleasure. The joy of getting a good deal.

108
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,600
Outlets are all on the outskirts. How can I hit all these outskirts at once? So I crossed the Alps and all...

109
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Incredible.

110
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:19,400
Now, Schiaparelli is a 19th-century person. He was born in 1890. Similar to Chanel. The designer Schiaparelli is only known to people who major in costume history. This person wrote an autobiography called "Shocking Life." I know it well because I translated this book.

111
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,200
"Shocking Life"? The color, "Shocking Pink."

112
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,400
That's right! That's it.

113
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh, that word comes to mind. Shocking Pink.

114
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Really? Now we can unravel it a bit.

115
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,400
Is "Shocking Pink" Schiaparelli?

116
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,600
It's the color of this person's perfume.

117
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,200
Everything is fragmented in my head.

118
00:10:36,000 --> 00:11:19,200
No, why is Shocking Pink famous? It's famous for a perfume bottle modeled after a Hollywood actress's breasts. But the perfume bottle and the wrapping paper were Shocking Pink, a deep pink color. From 1927 to 1954, he was very active. This was a time when the Great Depression hit the US, World War I, the Spanish Civil War, and World War II happened. He was a person who was at the center of all the rapidly changing events in modern history. Actually, if he wanted to live a comfortable life, he could have. His father was the dean of Rome University, a man of reputation.

119
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh.

120
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,200
He was from an intellectual family.

121
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,200
That's why Chanel felt more inferior.

122
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,600
Oh, was he a rival with Chanel?

123
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,800
Chanel hated him the most. He made dolls out of straw and stuck pins in them, hating him so much.

124
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Openly?

125
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,600
He hated him a lot. Because what Chanel wanted most was that well-educated people talk without being conscious, but something comes out...

126
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
The choice of words is different.

127
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Like Pastor Kim.

128
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Even if the assets are with the aunt.

129
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Haha.

130
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:32,000
When speaking, the intellectual aura should be revealed, but Chanel didn't have that. He was that kind of person. His father was the president, and he also served as the head of the library of Lincei, which has a very classy library of a university founded in the 1600s, like the scientist Galileo, you know Galileo Galilei. This woman started frequenting this library from a very young age. He read Spinoza's books, political philosophy books, and was armed with culture from a very young age. However, his outsider personality was so strong that his nannies couldn't stand him.

131
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,200
If they said something, he would talk back and argue logically.

132
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,400
There were many such things. He was intellectually precocious.

133
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's right. The expression "precocious" doesn't seem wrong.

134
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,600
But his liberal arts background is rich.

135
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:23,600
Rich. Besides, his father was an Orientalist. He was very familiar with Arabic and Sanskrit. And how good would the study be? He was a daughter who was allowed to enter the study since he was a university professor. From a young age, he was a troublemaker. When parachutes were first developed during World War I, he saw them and jumped from the second floor of his house with an open umbrella.

136
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,800
There are kids like that.

137
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,200
He was a bit of a troublemaker, but his mother always teased him for being ugly.

138
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,600
Is that why he became like this?

139
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:52,600
He was compared to his sister, who wasn't as good-looking. Schiaparelli said he had this daydream when he was young. "Is there a way to make flowers bloom on my face?" So he got seeds from a gardener, put them in his nostrils and ears, and fell asleep. But they actually bloomed.

140
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Haha.

141
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It probably swelled up. So doctors had to pull seeds out of his nose and things like that.

142
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He wasn't ordinary.

143
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,400
His imagination was rich. At the age of 14, he wrote an erotic book.

144
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
At 14?

145
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,200
He wrote erotic poems and was kicked out by his father.

146
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I see. His imagination was rich, and he was intellectually precocious, and he was outstanding in every way.

147
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,400
But he was ugly.

148
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Haha.

149
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Actually, as an adult, Schiaparelli's appearance, in my opinion, is better than Chanel's.

150
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,400
No, we have to look at the appearance of the sisters in that family.

151
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, that's right.

152
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,800
He overcame his complex like this when he grew up.

153
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:52,600
That's right. The expression "overcoming" is correct because he brought those childhood memories exactly as they were when he made clothes. He sewed with seeds in the pockets, like a gardener's clothes.

154
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,400
Thinking his face would become pretty after putting them in when he was young.

155
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Exactly.

156
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,600
Hoping flowers would grow from his nose.

157
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,800
Yes, he put petals in.

158
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,600
He put that imagination into his clothes.

159
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,400
Exactly. It's amazing when you think about it now.

160
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,800
His fantasy is very strong.

161
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:40,600
He's a person with strong fantasy. But he was a single mom. Schiaparelli. His husband was a scammer, but he must have been handsome. He had a strong relationship with Isadora Duncan... I'll stop here. Anyway, because of that, he got divorced and had a daughter, but the daughter suffered from polio. After the divorce, he came to Paris alone and started his career as a designer.

162
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,800
He's Italian, but he came to Paris and started his career as a fashion designer.

163
00:15:47,000 --> 00:16:02,600
To put it another way, he was an outsider. He had the sensibility of an outsider, he was a single mom, and his daughter was sick. It was a shackle. And he didn't have a professional degree.

164
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Ah.

165
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,200
He got married at 20. His father was really against it. He wanted him to study.

166
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Of course.

167
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,800
Since he's a person with strong fantasy, he married a person like a scammer pastor.

168
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
A scammer pastor.

169
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,400
Theosophy, which means studying knowledge about God, but actually the same feeling as Shincheonji. They're heretics who interpret eschatology.

170
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,400
Cults, things like that.

171
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,600
Exactly. But he was so handsome. So he fell in love at first sight and got married five days after they met.

172
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,600
So he married because of his fantasy.

173
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,400
He regretted it greatly.

174
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,200
Then when he got married, he must have spent all the money his father gave him.

175
00:16:43,000 --> 00:17:03,800
His husband spent all the dowry money on gambling and slept with Isadora Duncan and so on. From this man's point of view, he sucked the woman dry, and this woman became penniless. Exactly. He was embarrassed and felt he should live a new life, so he went to Paris.

176
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Exactly.

177
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,600
But how did he get into fashion?

178
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's very mysterious.

179
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,400
He has no background.

180
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:38,800
That's a good question. We have to keep in mind that Schiaparelli is a 19th-century person, and professional institutions for designers were starting to emerge, and even without a degree, career experience was necessary, right? He was someone who succeeded as a designer in a process where these things were completely non-existent. So when he succeeded in Paris, a fandom was formed. "You're Italian, how did you come to Paris and succeed as a designer?" "No professional knowledge, no degree." These questions started pouring in.

181
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,800
The person who first scouted him had a good eye.

182
00:17:43,000 --> 00:18:16,600
That person was Poiret. A designer named Paul Poiret, who was called the "King of Paris Fashion" in the early 20th century. He was much higher than Chanel. Later, he became a competitor with Chanel, but when Chanel was starting to do well, he met him on the street. I mentioned that Chanel made a little black dress. Seeing that, Poiret teased him and asked, "Whose funeral are you going to?" So Chanel retorted, "Your funeral, man!" and went on his way.

183
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,400
I like Chanel's personality.

184
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,800
Truly great. Saying "Your funeral." Chanel succeeded with his personality.

185
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:49,200
But this person named Poiret was also amazing. Even if we don't know art history today, even if we don't know the name Fauvism, we've heard of names like Henri Matisse. He was the first person to collaborate and do a collab between art and fashion.

186
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Okay.

187
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And he was the first person to open a fashion show in Paris.

188
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He's like the founder of the fashion industry.

189
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,800
Exactly. Before that, they didn't introduce clothes by dressing models. He held a garden party with live models wearing clothes.

190
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,200
Before, they used to dress mannequins.

191
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:23,600
They had a party and presented a collection by dressing models. Oh. What's amazing is that the people who modeled then were celebrities. People who corresponded to famous entertainers of that time.

192
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,600
André Kim got his motif from there.

193
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:50,200
Oh, exactly. So the people who modeled were dancers. Isadora Duncan, who is called the founder of modern dance. He just made clothes for her for free. He made clothes that would suit a dancer and told her, "Just come to my party and walk around." He was the first person to start something like this.

194
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
He's like the founder of modern fashion marketing.

195
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,600
Exactly. He had poets write advertising copy.

196
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh.

197
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:15,600
What's amazing is that people who studied French literature know these names. Rimbaud or Baudelaire. People who have done some literature will know these names. Surprisingly, this person wrote fashion advertising copy. When releasing perfume, he even wrote poems to introduce it.

198
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
He's also the founder of the literature collab.

199
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,200
Exactly. More importantly, you know labels attached to clothes, brand labels.

200
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The tag on the back of the neck.

201
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:50,600
This label was born because of this person. Designers didn't have labels on their clothes before. Oh. But Poiret was annoyed. He spent 200 hours making an evening dress, and 80 hours making a dress for daytime use. All those numerous artisans made it stitch by stitch.

202
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,400
Since he collaborated with artists, even if they draw a picture, they sign it.

203
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Exactly. Why isn't that on these clothes? Oh. Why can't I leave my signature? When we look at paintings by Renoir or Impressionists, there's Renoir's signature with the date. Why doesn't fashion receive such treatment as an artist?

204
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,200
There was no such thing before?

205
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,400
No. He broke this and started making these labels.

206
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:37,200
"I must put my name on my clothes like a signature on a painting." Almost all of modern fashion started here.

207
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You pointed out that it's the start of fashion marketing, and that's a very good insight. He made things like limited edition magazines. Do you know that magazines also come out from Dior?

208
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,600
I only know Wolmal as a magazine.

209
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Fashion brands make very high-quality magazines for their customers. Companies like Celine too.

210
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,200
It seems like everything being done now was already done then.

211
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:27,400
He did it all then. He's the founder of founders. Oh. The name of the magazine is also cool, "Gazette du Bon Ton," meaning "the journal of good taste." He was a designer who first started using the concept of lifestyle, centered on taste. Surprisingly, he did textile and fabric designs with Fauvist painters and even did sofa designs.

212
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,200
So it didn't end with clothes.

213
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:45,200
You know shops like Muji or Jaju. It's the same for Hermès. It's called a maison. From home wear worn at home to interior accessories and furniture design. He was the first person to do that.

214
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
He's the father.

215
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
He's the father.

216
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,800
He brought art into fashion.

217
00:22:49,000 --> 00:23:05,800
Schiap worked under this person. You asked what the trigger was. He came to Paris penniless, but because he was well-educated, he had high standards. He couldn't just pass by Paul Poiret's store, as a single mom holding a child.

218
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,200
He was a customer at first.

219
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:32,400
He was hesitating whether it would be okay, and he met Poiret in the store. "Mademoiselle, try on what you want to wear. Don't hesitate, you don't have to buy it. If there's an outfit you really like and are attracted to, try it on and just tell me a word or two about why you're attracted to it."

220
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,400
He must have said a word or two excellently.

221
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:46,800
He said a word or two coolly and confessed that he really wanted to wear it. But Poiret just gave him the clothes for free.

222
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Poiret is cooler.

223
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:07,200
Really? Than Schiap? It's not "Schiapy." Let's stick with Elsa. But actually, Schiap, Schiap, you said that. The Italian pronunciation "Schiaparelli" was difficult even for French people. So they called him by a nickname, and I was surprised that you said it. They called him "Schiap."

224
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
I'll go with "Schiap."

225
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,600
Then Poiret said, "Try making a sketch of the clothes you want."

226
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:47,800
Poiret, who had an eye for art, at first felt sorry for him as he was holding a baby and gave him clothes, but after listening to him talk, his style was educated. He knew. Hearing him talk, "Oh, this person is more than just someone to feel sorry for, I might be able to use him somewhere." That's how it started, so to speak.

227
00:24:41,000 --> 00:25:16,200
Poiret established a free art school called Atelier to raise artists at that time. Fauvist painters were teachers. It's amazing if you think about it now. He made people learn under them, and the condition was not to learn traditional fashion education, but to think about fashion completely anew. He chose girls from poor backgrounds without prejudice and taught them for free. Because he was that kind of person, there might have been such an aspect. So Schiap sold sketches to this person as a trigger.

228
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,400
"What can you do?"

229
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:40,000
He must have said something like, "I like sculpture and art, can I try drawing clothes that I can realize?" At that time, many artists supported themselves by selling their fashion sketches like that. Dior did that too.

230
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,600
It happened because of a chance meeting.

231
00:25:43,000 --> 00:26:31,800
It's serendipity. But it happened. So he sold one or two, and Poiret really liked them. He told him to try going independent and that he would support him, "Why don't you try having your own shop?" and told him to try his first collection. Professors in Korea also do this, but this is actually spitting on my own face, but many people point out that a problem with Korean fashion education is that when designers become professors, the limit is that they keep making replicas of themselves. They instill the designs and thoughts they were good at into students, so these disciples cannot get out of the teacher's shadow. Actually, such things are called limits. Poiret goes beyond this.

232
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,200
"Do what you want to do."

233
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Actually.
