(Car starting sounds)

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:55,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: This is Kim Eo-jun from the end-of-the-month Kim Eo-jun. We've heard about North and South Pole, Everest, Bering Strait, Greenland polar expeditions. We've heard about non-motorized yacht world circumnavigation maritime expeditions. We've heard about aviation expeditions crossing the Himalayas in a hang glider, cave explorations, and recently we met Jang Ji-hoon, the only person in Korea who holds the 100-meter free diving record. Jang Ji-hoon broke the Korean record at an international free diving competition with the support of end-of-the-month Kim Eo-jun and wearing the end-of-the-month Kim Eo-jun logo. (Applause and cheers) So, to celebrate Jang Ji-hoon's new Korean record, we've invited a bunch of amateur free divers in their 30s who think "I can do it too." Hello.

4
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
**Guests**: Hello.

5
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:46,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: I invited amateur free divers in their 30s who have been diving for less than two years. Let's start with Oh Ye-seon, a nurse at a university hospital with two years of experience.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: Yes, hello. (Applause) I clapped for myself.

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: And office worker Hong Min-ji.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
**Hong Min-ji**: Yes, nice to meet you. (Applause)

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Hong Min-ji has been doing it for a year and a half.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,600
**Hong Min-ji**: Yes, about a year and a half.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Park Min-joo, who used to be a shopping mall MD.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
**Park Min-joo**: Oh, hello. (Applause)

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: 10 months of experience.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
**Park Min-joo**: Yes, 10 months.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: And office worker Kim Geun-ho.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,200
**Kim Geun-ho**: Yes, I'm Kim Geun-ho. Hello. (Applause)

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: 1 year and 5 months of experience.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: About that much.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Office worker Han Gyu-beom. 10 months of experience.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,400
**Han Gyu-beom**: Yes, that's right. (Applause)

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: For your information, the introductions are in order of experience. Han Gyu-beom is Park Min-joo's boyfriend.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
**Park Min-joo**: Ah, yes. (Laughter)

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:51,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: So the speaking time for the couple will be combined. Let's start from here. Everyone is in their 30s and busy with daily life. How did you get into this useless sport of diving deep into water, which doesn't help your life at all? From Oh Ye-seon.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: I saw people free diving in Ulleungdo on the show '2 Days & 1 Night', and I suddenly had the urge to try it.

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Without any prior information? Did you swim before?

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:32,200
**Oh Ye-seon**: I can't swim. I still can't swim, and I have no connection to the sea at all. I wasn't born near the sea, and no one in my family is a haenyeo (female diver). But I suddenly wanted to do it after seeing it on TV.

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Why did you want to do it?

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: I still don't know. So I thought I'd just get a taste and went for a one-day experience.

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Did you search the internet for a place?

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:00,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: Yes, I searched the internet for a place and a teacher I wanted, still not knowing why. I met my current teacher and went for the experience, and it suited me well.

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Even though you can't swim?

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: I can't even float, but I'm good at sinking.

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Sinking is quite painful.

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: It is. Sorry.

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: That was out of the blue.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,800
**Kim Geun-ho**: Out of the blue, yes.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Hong Min-ji.

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,400
**Hong Min-ji**: Yes, I'm Hong. I did Pilates for a long time on weekdays while working.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: What does that have to do with this?

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:44,600
**Hong Min-ji**: Oh, please listen to the end. I've been working a lot of overtime lately, to the point where I couldn't even go to Pilates. My neck and back hurt, so I was looking for an exercise that wasn't too strenuous or stressful.

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Did your day and night switch?

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:58,400
**Hong Min-ji**: No, I'm just a normal 9-to-6 office worker, but I had a lot of overtime for a long time. I'd eat dinner and work until 1 AM, making reports. That kind of life continued.

43
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Are you related to the president?

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
(Laughter)

45
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:29,200
**Hong Min-ji**: So I wanted something on the weekends that wasn't too hard on my body. Coincidentally, a junior from university was an instructor. I saw her Instagram and thought, "I should just do it." I've liked water since I was a kid. I thought I could use my body freely in the water. That's how I started.

46
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: It's not like it's not strenuous to go deep into the water.

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:42,600
**Hong Min-ji**: But at that point, I didn't even think about going deep. I just realized I was going deep as I did it.

48
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
(Laughter)

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: You didn't even know it was a sport where you go deep.

50
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,400
**Hong Min-ji**: I just wanted to roll around freely in the water. My joints hurt, you know? You shouldn't overdo it.

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: You didn't know anything. And Park Min-joo, who's only been doing it for 10 months.

52
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,600
**Park Min-joo**: Yes, I'm Park. My boyfriend actually has a severe phobia of water.

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: A water phobia, even?

54
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,800
**Park Min-joo**: Truly. To what extent? We've been together for 7 years.

55
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: You've been together for too long.

56
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,600
**Park Min-joo**: We've never even been to a valley in those 7 years because he's so afraid of water.

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Wait, Han Gyu-beom.

58
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: Yes, I'm Han.

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: So you can't swim and you're afraid of water so you don't go near it?

60
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: Yes.

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Why would someone who's so afraid of water do this?

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:40,000
**Park Min-joo**: Last year, out of the blue, he said he wanted to go to a valley. So we went once, and then he said he wanted to try snorkeling.

63
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Suddenly?

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,200
**Park Min-joo**: Yes, suddenly. So we bought snorkeling gear and went to Janghohang.

65
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Suddenly, for someone who can't swim?

66
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:53,800
**Park Min-joo**: Yes, really. We went there, and two women wearing really pretty fins were going into the water. We were just using these 30cm yellow fins...

67
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: They looked cool.

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:09,200
**Park Min-joo**: We were using those, and those two women had these long fins. He was like, "What's that?" He's really afraid of water, but he got curious.

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Let's hear the boyfriend's version.

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,200
**Han Gyu-beom**: What did I see? Last year, I enjoyed watching a YouTuber called 'Valley is Gyul Gyul'.

71
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: You were getting vicarious satisfaction.

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,800
**Han Gyu-beom**: I was watching him and getting vicarious satisfaction. Then one day, I also wanted to be free in the water.

73
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: When did your water phobia start?

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,600
**Han Gyu-beom**: When I was young, I almost drowned...

75
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,200
**Oh Ye-seon**: No way! You wouldn't be here.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Usually, there has to be a trauma like that.

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,800
**Han Gyu-beom**: I swallowed a lot of water. Since then, I had a phobia. But watching that YouTuber, I got that desire.

78
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: You wanted to overcome it.

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,200
**Han Gyu-beom**: Yes, I had that desire, so I said let's go play.

80
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: How deep was the valley?

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
**Park Min-joo**: Knee-deep. (Laughter)

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:17,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: You didn't even go into the water! Even at knee-deep, you were screaming. Shouldn't you go to a hospital for that?

83
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:41,800
**Han Gyu-beom**: So I just went to play once. It was so much fun. After 20 years, I finally went into a stream at knee-depth and was screaming with joy. I had a primary victory. I succeeded in contacting water. Then I wanted to play more in the water, and I found out many people do snorkeling.

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: You skipped a lot. From a knee-deep stream straight to snorkeling?

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:05,200
**Han Gyu-beom**: So I wanted to go to Janghohang, the mecca of snorkeling. I just blindly went. I really have no foundation. I skipped everything. I blindly bought snorkeling gear, a mask, and a life jacket and went.

86
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Even though you'd never been in the water before, you bought the gear.

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,600
**Han Gyu-beom**: I just went to the sea. I almost died then. But I got hooked on the water.

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: You saw a new world. Not those women.

89
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:36,400
**Han Gyu-beom**: I'd been afraid all my life, went to a knee-deep stream, and then straight to the sea. I was scared, but the view was so beautiful that I just lost my mind. But then I saw those long fins.

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:48,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Those looked cooler. This whole process of deciding seems a bit lacking. Afraid for 20 years, then a stream, then snorkeling, then straight to free diving.

91
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,800
**Han Gyu-beom**: There was no middle ground.

92
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: "Let's learn that"?

93
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,800
**Park Min-joo**: Yes, my boyfriend, who was so afraid of water, suggested we do free diving first.

94
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: The first two people are also absurd. You're even more absurd.

95
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,200
**Han Gyu-beom**: Like I said, I really wanted to go into the water. I wanted to overcome it.

96
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Do you two know how to swim?

97
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: I liked it.

98
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,400
**Park Min-joo**: I've just started learning.

99
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Just started learning. And Kim Geun-ho?

100
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: Yes.

101
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: How did you start?

102
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:41,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: I have a story too. I also had a water phobia since I was young. When my family found out I was free diving, they were amazed because I wouldn't even go near water.

103
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: All of you should have gone to a hospital.

104
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,800
**Kim Geun-ho**: When I was very young, I fell into a valley.

105
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Just like Han Gyu-beom.

106
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: And when I came to, there were 10,000 won and 5,000 won bills all over the tent...

107
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Why the money?

108
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: My father jumped in with his wallet still on him to save me.

109
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Drying out the money. It's important. Drying the son and the money.

110
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:22,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: Anyway, since then, my intelligence dropped a bit, but it's okay. (Laughter) One joke worked. So I lived with that phobia. I didn't go near water, so I didn't think about it.

111
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: You unconsciously avoided water.

112
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:44,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: Right. Even seeing the Han River made me feel a bit scared. But one day in my 20s, I went on a working holiday to Australia. I went on a Great Barrier Reef tour and tried an experience dive.

113
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Another person who skipped learning to swim for 20 years and went straight to diving.

114
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:03,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: You have to do the famous tours when you're there. I tried the experience dive. I couldn't do it. My fear came back. I was really scared. But I paid a lot of money.

115
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Money is important.

116
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:16,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: Right. Suddenly I thought of the tent, and thought, "I paid for this, I have to do it." So I forced myself. It was good, it was fun.

117
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: You overcame it because of the money.

118
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: It was great. So when I came back to Korea, I learned scuba diving and got my license.

119
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: You got your license?

120
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: Open water. I learned scuba diving properly.

121
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: So you overcame it.

122
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,800
**Kim Geun-ho**: But it didn't feel overcome. I was still really scared.

123
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
(Laughter)

124
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: You have the license but you're still scared.

125
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:47,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: Usually, a tank has 200 bar, and most people use it for about 20 minutes. But I was so excited, I used it all in 10 minutes.

126
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: You were hyperventilating because you were scared.

127
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:06,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: Yeah, so I'd show the instructor, and he'd be like, "Why are you using air so fast?" I thought it was because I'm big, but it was because I couldn't relax. Hyperventilation.

128
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: So you went in with gear, but the phobia wasn't gone.

129
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,200
**Kim Geun-ho**: It wasn't the right sport for me. I got the license and never went diving again.

130
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: These guys are strange. You got the license and never used it, so why free diving?

131
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,200
**Kim Geun-ho**: An older brother I know became an instructor. He said he'd give me a discount. In the end, it's about money.

132
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Discount!

133
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: So I did it, and strangely, it went well.

134
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Better than with a tank? What about the phobia?

135
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:14,200
**Kim Geun-ho**: I forgot about it. This sport, even though you don't have gear, I can just go in. Of course, I wasn't good from the start. I don't think that either. But somehow, I was the best among the students. I even became like the class president.

136
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Then the people you met there must have thought you never had a phobia and were naturally good.

137
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,200
**Kim Geun-ho**: They probably think I'm naturally good.

138
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Did you figure out why this works when other things didn't?

139
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: My guess is, since I was the class president, a sense of responsibility?

140
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: That has nothing to do with free diving. Why did you fall for this, Hong Min-ji?

141
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,400
**Hong Min-ji**: There's a meditation effect.

142
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Meditation effect.

143
00:14:46,000 --> 00:15:10,000
**Hong Min-ji**: We're always running our brains at full power. But when you do this, you have to use your brain less. In fact, you stop thinking altogether because you're trying to survive. You only focus on surviving, so you forget things like "I have to prepare this for my meeting later." You just forget everything and focus on enduring.

144
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Because it's an activity tied to survival, you focus solely on that.

145
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:22,600
**Hong Min-ji**: You cast everything else aside. You just forget. You lose yourself. I'm an MBTI 'J', very 'J'. I'm always planning. My mind is busy, moving fast. But when I'm in the water...

146
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: You forget it all.

147
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,800
**Hong Min-ji**: Because I can put it all down. I think that's why I keep doing it.

148
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Are you addicted?

149
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:54,200
**Hong Min-ji**: He mentioned 'water뽕' (water high). When I see water, I want to go in. It draws me in. And you know, hotel pools, people used to go there to take photos. Now, I don't even look at shallow pools. They're useless.

150
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Useless?

151
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:05,000
**Hong Min-ji**: Right? It has to be at least 5 meters. But even 5 meters is too shallow now. I agree. That's just how it became. I think everyone agrees.

152
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,200
**Park Min-joo**: Actually, this is a sport that's hard to even consider starting.

153
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: There's a barrier to entry.

154
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:29,800
**Park Min-joo**: Right. You think you need to be a good swimmer, you need training, you need a lot of gear, and it's scary. But that's also part of the charm. "I do this. I went this deep." The satisfaction Hong Min-ji mentioned, and the feeling of people saying "Wow, you're amazing."

155
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:42,800
**Hong Min-ji**: If it was gym-going, you wouldn't have called us. You called us because we do this. Why are these people going so deep? It's useless.

156
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: I thought I might eventually get some media attention.

157
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:55,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Jang Ji-hoon, who holds the only 100m diving record in Korea, also suddenly thought, "This is what I should do," and quit his job.

158
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: He quit his job to do it. He didn't do it before. These people have no foundation.

159
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,800
**Kim Geun-ho**: You find out very quickly. If you try an experience dive and you can't do it, you'll never do it.

160
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: He quit his job and then started, not the other way around. That's amazing.

161
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,800
**Kim Geun-ho**: There are people like that.

162
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:27,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Han Gyu-beom, who had a severe phobia, you probably couldn't dive at first. How can you dive if you're afraid of water?

163
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:41,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: At first, it was really scary. We were training in a 5-meter pool, and we had to go down holding a rope. The moment I dipped my face in, I came right back up. I was so scared.

164
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: The moment you grabbed the rope?

165
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:50,800
**Han Gyu-beom**: The moment I put my face in, it was so scary. Plus, I couldn't swim. Having my whole face submerged in water was terrifying. At that point, judging by the situation, I should have quit.

166
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: There are people like this too. Let me rephrase.

167
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: How did you overcome it?

168
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:08,400
**Han Gyu-beom**: I think it was my will to be free in the water. I overcame the fear with will. I kept doing it, and bit by bit, it got better.

169
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Why do you keep doing it, now that you've overcome it?

170
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,400
**Han Gyu-beom**: Like Hong Min-ji said, when I'm in the water, it's time for a conversation with myself. Only with myself.

171
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: What kind of conversation?

172
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: (Laughter) It's like meditation. I cast aside all stray thoughts, let everything go, and meet my inner self.

173
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: I asked about the content of the conversation!

174
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,600
**Han Gyu-beom**: "Gotta endure 5 more seconds..." Like that.

175
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:53,800
**Han Gyu-beom**: And when you're in the water, looking up at the surface is so beautiful. Pools are beautiful, but in the sea, the sunlight piercing through the surface is truly beautiful.

176
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: It gives you a fantasy-like feeling of being in an unrealistic space.

177
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,200
**Han Gyu-beom**: That ecstasy is so beautiful. That's why I keep doing it.

178
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:26,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: It's like a zero-gravity space. People who free dive call it 'water뽕'. I hated that word at first. "Why use such a word?" But later, I was saying "I think I'm on a water high." If I have even a bit of free time in my schedule, I'm like, "I should go diving."

179
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Water zombies. So you only hang out with people like that? In that tank? Do they all say similar things?

180
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:49,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: Most people probably think similarly. We use similar terms, too. Like "Equalizing isn't working." The way we explain things is very similar.

181
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:04,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Let's move on to the next step. To go deep, you need to train to adjust the pressure. That's called equalizing, pinching your nose...

182
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: I can equalize without using my hands. BTV technique.

183
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: BTV?

184
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: I move my eustachian tube directly to open it up, and it equalizes.

185
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Without pinching your nose and blowing?

186
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: Yes, I do it without my hands.

187
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: How?

188
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:43,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: I move the muscles inside my ears. Some people have sensitive nerves for that. I didn't know I was doing it. When I was young and had ear infections, my ears would feel blocked, so I think I was doing Frenzel then. I hated my ears being blocked, so I'd always blow...

189
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: You used to do it with your hands, but then you moved certain facial muscles...

190
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:58,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: I move them inside, and I hear a clicking sound. Click, click, click. Then I can equalize without my hands. It's much more comfortable when diving because it saves oxygen.

191
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: It's possible?

192
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,200
**Kim Geun-ho**: Wow, really? But I'm similar. My ears used to get blocked easily since I was young.

193
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Everyone's the same!

194
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:29,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: Right. I'm like that too. My ears get blocked easily. So in the 63 Building elevator, they'd say, "Gulp to clear your ears." At that time, I wondered why I had to swallow.

195
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: You were already doing it unconsciously.

196
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:43,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: I was equalizing, not knowing that's what it was. When I started learning, I was like, "Oh, this is it?" Then I heard "You're a genius at equalizing."

197
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
(Laughter)

198
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,800
**Kim Geun-ho**: That feeling of being good! That's important. "I'm a genius." This really suits me, and I got even more addicted.

199
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Hong Min-ji.

200
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,600
**Hong Min-ji**: BTV is for people who are really good or lucky. Most people are recommended the Frenzel technique.

201
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: How do you do Frenzel?

202
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
**Hong Min-ji**: You pinch your nose and use pressure. Luckily, I could do that right away. I've always liked water.

203
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,800
**Han Gyu-beom**: Some people can't do it for months. It took me almost 7 or 8 months.

204
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: How do you know if it worked?

205
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,200
**Han Gyu-beom**: The instructor says "Oh, it worked."

206
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: How does he know what's happening in your ear?

207
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: He sees my movements. "Oh, you're doing it." These muscles move. The neck muscles have to move. (Shows)

208
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Like a fish. The throat is pulsing.

209
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: What the host mentioned about pinching your nose and blowing is the Valsalva technique. But that uses abdominal pressure, which is disadvantageous for diving.

210
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Ah, I see.

211
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: So without using abdominal pressure, you use the pressure from the root of your tongue to open the tube. That's the Frenzel technique.

212
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:28,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Sorry, I'll explain for the listeners who might be confused. There are four main equalizing techniques. The most basic is swallowing (Toynbee). Then Valsalva. Pinching your nose and blowing with your gut. That's what people do on planes. But that uses too much oxygen and energy in the water. So the most common is Frenzel. You lock the system here... (Shows) You use the glottis... You lock the glottis... You use the air in the sinuses to open your ears.

213
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: How does that happen?

214
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: Put the tip of your tongue between your teeth and gums. Then do this. (Makes a sound)

215
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:55,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: It's hard to feel in the air, you can feel it better in the water. You have to do it in the water.

216
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:01,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: But for some people it's quick, for others it takes a long time. Park Min-joo liked water but it took 7 months.

217
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,600
**Park Min-joo**: Yes, and even now I'm not perfect, so I mix it with Valsalva. We call it 'Valenzel'.

218
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: What's the fourth one?

219
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,800
**Kim Geun-ho**: BTV. Doing it without hands.

220
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: People who are born with it. Like telekinesis, doing it without hands.

221
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,200
**Kim Geun-ho**: Out of 100 people, how many?

222
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:35,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: About 0.1% or 0.01%? People born with it. They say there aren't many. But for me, if the conditions are good, BTV works up to 10 or 12 meters. But deeper than that, it doesn't.

223
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: You're a 10-meter guy.

224
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,200
**Oh Ye-seon**: Yes. I'm up to 30 meters.

225
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:53,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: She's the best. 2 years experience. I'll defer to you. Park Min-joo liked water but it took 7 months. You didn't like water and couldn't swim, how long did it take?

226
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:11,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: It took me about 4 months. I worked really hard. I did it on my way to work, in the bathroom... I kept practicing. To the point where my nose got sore and I had to apply Vaseline.

227
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Why was it sore?

228
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: Because I had to keep pinching and releasing it. My nose was sore.

229
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: I can see your fingerprints on your nose. I have a habit of throwing things out. Sorry.

230
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Basically, if you can't do this, you can't go into the water.

231
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: Right. If equalizing doesn't work, the quality of free diving drops significantly.

232
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: What happens if you go in without it?

233
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: It's so painful you can't go in. Because of the pressure imbalance.

234
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: Free diving starts with equalizing.

235
00:25:46,000 --> 00:26:00,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: You were always afraid of water but "free diving starts with equalizing." First, you have to match the pressure. Next, you have to hold your breath for a long time. How do you practice that?

236
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: You have to do a lot of dry training.

237
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Dry training?

238
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: CO2 training. Training outside the water. Mental control is important. Lowering your heart rate.

239
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Where and how do ordinary people do that?

240
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:48,000
**Hong Min-ji**: My diving center has many regular training sessions. We do something called a CO2 table. It's to build tolerance for carbon dioxide. It's like a timetable tailored to your body. You keep cycling through it. A professional instructor must be with you for safety. If you're going back and forth 50 meters, you wait 60 seconds, go and come back. Wait 50 seconds, go and come back. Wait 40 seconds... You gradually reduce the time you can breathe.

241
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Does the time you can hold your breath really increase?

242
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:14,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: It really does. I used to hate holding my breath. We call it 'static'. To get my master's license, the requirement is 3 minutes 30 seconds. I couldn't get past 3 minutes. It was so hard. "Why can't I do what everyone else does?"

243
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Not everyone does it.

244
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:32,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: But I'm an equalizing genius! "I equalized so well, why can't I do static?" So I started practicing on my own. Before bed, I changed the lights in my room to blue.

245
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Everyone is crazy.

246
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: But I slept so well! I'd fall asleep doing static.

247
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: You'd fall asleep while practicing holding your breath?

248
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:56,200
**Oh Ye-seon**: I'd set it for 1 minute, relax for 1 minute 30 seconds, hold for 1 minute. Relax for 1 minute 15 seconds, hold for 1 minute.

249
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Relaxing means breathing.

250
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: Yes, relaxing is breathing. But I relaxed too much and fell asleep.

251
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,600
**Han Gyu-beom**: It's a common experience. I do dry CO2 training too, and I often fall asleep while relaxing.

252
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: It lowers your heart rate, so it has a relaxing effect.

253
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: Your parasympathetic nervous system activates, and you fall asleep.

254
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: You've reached the point where it borders on sleep.

255
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:33,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: But it really helps. I increased my time to 4 minutes 11 seconds. I hit my personal best recently.

256
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Not a pro, but 2 years of practice and you reached 4 minutes?

257
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
**Park Min-joo**: 4 minutes? Did you die? That's a eulogy.

258
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: What's everyone else's record?

259
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
**Hong Min-ji**: It's been a while for me, but it was 3 minutes 23 seconds.

260
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: 3 minutes. Park Min-joo?

261
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,400
**Park Min-joo**: 2 minutes 4 seconds.

262
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Why so short? You said you liked water.

263
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:07,400
**Park Min-joo**: I'm a bit scattered. When I dip my face in, my mind starts looking for things. Like, "I should count the mold on the pool floor from here to here." My mind is busy.

264
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Mold?

265
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:24,400
**Park Min-joo**: Counting the mold on the bottom. To forget that I have to hold my breath, I look for something to focus on. But that consumes too much oxygen. I'm using my brain too much.

266
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: What about the boyfriend?

267
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: 3 minutes.

268
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Kim Geun-ho?

269
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: 3 minutes 28 seconds.

270
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Peace of mind is important here.

271
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:39,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: Right. The moment you lose it, the relaxation is gone. If you start feeling anxious, your time drops significantly.

272
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:57,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Jang Ji-hoon said the same thing. How to find a stable psychological state? When you become one with the water, you can go deep and stay longer. You're all looking for that moment of becoming one with the water.

273
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: Everyone has their own way. Finding the method that works for you is important.

274
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: What's your method?

275
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: Now I don't think about anything. But before, I'd think about my work routine at the hospital.

276
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Thinking about something to forget the pain.

277
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
**Park Min-joo**: I think of song lyrics. Just one song.

278
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: You all do strange things.

279
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:50,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: At first, focusing helped me do well. But as I went on, my static time didn't increase. Concentrating on one thing is nothing compared to clearing your mind. So I started meditating. They said it helps a lot. I'm not a fan of meditation, I can't stay still. But it helped. This sport is very dependent on your psychological state. That makes it more charming.

280
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,400
**Hong Min-ji**: Right, a mental sport.

281
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Kim Geun-ho seems like he'd be weak at mental sports. Too many thoughts. What's your maximum depth?

282
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: 26 meters.

283
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: For those who haven't learned, how deep can they go?

284
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,400
**Park Min-joo**: If equalizing doesn't work, even 5 meters is hard.

285
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:33,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: I'm a good swimmer. I could easily go down and back in a 5-meter pool when I was in my 20s.

286
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,200
**Hong Min-ji**: You must have been doing BTV. You're born with it. Or it wasn't really 5 meters.

287
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: I know that much! Today's concept is "I can do it too." How deep do beginners go? What difficulties do they face?

288
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:04,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: If you can equalize, anyone can go 5 or 10 meters. It's the ear pain that stops people. But that can take months. Then it's about holding your breath.

289
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: So 26 meters.

290
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: 33 meters.

291
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:17,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: 26m, 33m. Ordinary people can't do that even with equalizing because they can't hold their breath. Park Min-joo?

292
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
**Park Min-joo**: 12.6 meters.

293
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: She has too many thoughts. Equalizing was slow too. Han Gyu-beom?

294
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: 22 meters.

295
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: See? It has nothing to do with whether you could swim or were afraid of water.

296
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,200
**Kim Geun-ho**: I'm at 34.3 meters. I touched the bottom of Deep Station.

297
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Deep Station?

298
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: It's the deepest pool in our country, in Yongin. It's called Deep Station.

299
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Touching that bottom is a milestone.

300
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: He's doing his master's. I'm SSI level 2. Equivalent to AIDA 3. Intermediate.

301
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: What's AIDA?

302
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: A license organization.

303
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: There's AIDA, PADI, SSI... How many are there?

304
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:19,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: Quite a few. They're all international licenses. About 4 or 5 major ones. People usually ask if you're level 2 or 3.

305
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: What's intermediate?

306
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:44,800
**Hong Min-ji**: For PADI Advanced Free Diver, level 3, you have to go past 20 meters. Depth-wise. And hold your breath for about 2 minutes 30 seconds.

307
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: For someone like Han Gyu-beom, who couldn't swim and was afraid, how long to reach that level?

308
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:07,400
**Han Gyu-beom**: Some people do it in 3 or 4 months. For someone like me who had to work for it, it might take a year.

309
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:13,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: Eventually, you get there with effort. No one fails. Even me, it took 7 months, but I did it.

310
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Even with counting mold and not practicing.

311
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
(Laughter)

312
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
**Park Min-joo**: It doesn't work well the day after drinking.

313
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Why not?

314
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:47,800
**Park Min-joo**: Your capillaries are blocked... something about bleeding... it just doesn't work. Pressure adjustment is hard. They tell you not to drink before diving. And no caffeine. It increases your heart rate. No chocolate, no dairy.

315
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:01,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: This is related to heart rate and blood vessels. Blood oxygen concentration. I'll ask Jang Ji-hoon about that.

316
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: How did you overcome the fear?

317
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:28,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: Going in often is the answer. That's the biggest thing. To go 26 meters, the deep cylinder starts from 10 meters. Passing through that was so scary. Once I was so scared I threw off my mask and came up.

318
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: That's even scarier! You can't see anything.

319
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:50,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: I was going to die. It was a primal fear. But then I'd think, "Why am I doing this? Why am I suffering like this?" It's like going into a dark jar in the sea. The color changes suddenly.

320
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: You can see the bottom, and then suddenly you can't. It gets dark.

321
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:17,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: Right. And when the water temperature changes, fear hits you. I tried not to overcome it at first because it was scary. "I'll just go this far." But as I did it, I wanted to reach that point to say I do free diving.

322
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: So how did you overcome it?

323
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: I just went often. There was no other way but to get used to it.

324
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: So anyone can do it. No special talent needed. Now, gear. First, why a wetsuit?

325
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:59,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: Body temperature. It's cold deep down. And in water, you lose heat 25 to 30 times faster than in air.

326
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: It's in the textbook.

327
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:16,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: The speed of heat loss is fast. If you get hypothermia and start shivering, you can't stay calm. So you wear a suit for temperature. Is it warm?

328
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: Yes, you don't feel the cold at all in the sea. It's amazing.

329
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Is there a specific free diving suit?

330
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: Yes, there is.

331
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: What about sizes?

332
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: There are many. Most people get custom-made suits.

333
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: How much?

334
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
**Hong Min-ji**: Mine was over 500,000 won. About 550,000 won.

335
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:59,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: Usually starts from 300,000 to 400,000 won. Cheap ones are 300,000 won. There are even 100,000 or 200,000 won ones.

336
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: What's the difference with expensive ones?

337
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: Flexibility. It's much more comfortable.

338
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Expensive ones are 700,000 to 800,000 won. That's not too bad.

339
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: And pools rent them out now, so you don't necessarily need one to learn.

340
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:32,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: But you have to buy the gear first. Gear high! Hobbies are about gear. You have to buy it and touch it and think "When can I use this?" You know what I mean!

341
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: Right, gear is a big part of it.

342
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Does the suit cover your whole body?

343
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: Not hands and feet. Your face is out, of course.

344
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: What about people who aren't a standard size?

345
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,200
**Kim Geun-ho**: If you go where I recommend, they have up to 65 sizes. Give me a call.

346
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Next, goggles.

347
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:22,400
**Hong Min-ji**: We call them masks. They're different from normal goggles because they cover your nose. You have to equalize, so it has to be soft and flexible around the nose.

348
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: How much?

349
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,400
**Park Min-joo**: Cheap ones are around 100,000 won. It depends on the material, glass or plastic.

350
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Glass would be more expensive.

351
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
**Park Min-joo**: High-strength glass.

352
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Expensive ones?

353
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,600
**Park Min-joo**: Around 200,000 or 300,000 won. 150,000 won.

354
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Suit 700,000, mask 300,000. Next, snorkel.

355
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:10,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: You use it while relaxing on the surface before you go in. You face the water and relax.

356
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Next, fins. Long fins.

357
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: Cheap ones are about 200,000 won. Expensive ones are around 1 million won.

358
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Those are more expensive.

359
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:35,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: Good ones are made of carbon. Light and powerful. Great propulsion. They're bouncy. There are mono-fins (one piece) and bi-fins (two pieces). Pros use mono-fins.

360
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:58,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Most people use bi-fins. So for under 2 million won, you can get good gear. That's cheap for a gear-heavy sport. You can buy it all online.

361
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: It's cheapest through an instructor.

362
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Any other gear?

363
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: A computer. A diving computer that tracks depth.

364
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: A watch?

365
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,800
**Kim Geun-ho**: Why call it a computer? It's not just for time.

366
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,800
**Han Gyu-beom**: It's a Garmin Descent... Should I not say the brand?

367
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
(Laughter)

368
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:45,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Are you worried it'll sell too well? Anyway, a watch. In this world, it's a computer. It syncs with an app, so it shows where I dived, how many times, how deep, and the temperature.

369
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:14,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: An Apple Watch does more than that, but we call it a watch. I can't win this argument. Anyway, a computer. They were using it before these fancy apps came out, so they called it a computer. Suit, fins, snorkel, computer. Anything else?

370
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:48,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: A lanyard. It's like a lifeline. In the sea, we use a buoy. We drop a rope from the buoy to practice depth. You tie yourself to that so you don't get swept away by the current. Most important gear in the sea.

371
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Doesn't the buoy get swept away too? How do you fix the buoy?

372
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:07,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: There's a fixed buoy. Or it's connected to the bottom. Sometimes we use a heavy lead weight. Or sometimes the buoy just drifts, and a boat stays nearby.

373
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Do you dive without it?

374
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,600
**Hong Min-ji**: For 'fun diving', looking at things underwater.

375
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: 'Fun' diving. (Laughter) You use strange terms. How is it different from snorkeling?

376
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:51,600
**Hong Min-ji**: Snorkeling is just on the surface. Breathing through the snorkel. With a life jacket. You can't go down with a life jacket.

377
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: So you go to the sea. For people who can't swim, it's impossible.

378
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:19,200
**Han Gyu-beom**: You can do it if you have fins. Fins are powerful, they overcome the current. You feel like a swimmer. The suit provides buoyancy too. You might not know how to swim, but with training and gear, you're like a pro.

379
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:37,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: You learned free diving without learning to swim. And you're swimming in the sea with a suit and fins?

380
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,400
**Han Gyu-beom**: Yes, in the water.

381
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: What about on the surface?

382
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:51,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: You can just float. Because of the suit's buoyancy. We set it for neutral buoyancy at 10 meters.

383
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:58,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: With the suit and a weight belt. You wear lead on your waist. So at 10 meters, you neither float nor sink.

384
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Your lungs are full. 'Full-lung'. (Laughter)

385
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: You find the right balance for yourself. You keep adding weight until you're neutral at 10 meters.

386
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Neutral buoyancy isn't a hard concept. You don't float or sink at 10 meters.

387
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,200
**Han Gyu-beom**: You have to find that. So at the surface, you float.

388
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: So there's no fear of drowning.

389
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,600
**Han Gyu-beom**: If you wear fins! I can't swim, so fins give me confidence. Confidence that I won't die.

390
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: You really need to see a doctor. You wear fins even on land? For confidence?

391
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:33,400
**Han Gyu-beom**: They're that powerful. I'm also not a good swimmer, but with fins, I feel like a pro. One kick and you're gone. It's anyone's sport. And you get addicted.

392
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:57,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Addicted to 'no thoughts', 'conversation with yourself'. Many reasons. So you only hang out at the pool, then eventually go to the sea?

393
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
**Guests**: Yes.

394
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: You like the dark sea where you can't see the bottom?

395
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:22,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: I like it more. Passing through that dark cylinder in the pool. After overcoming that fear, it's gone.

396
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,600
**Han Gyu-beom**: I'm still scared, but I enjoy it.

397
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: I was curious about that because I've felt it. It's scary. Warm here, cold there.

398
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: It's scary, but curiosity is bigger. "I want to go down there."

399
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:03,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: It's scary for someone who hasn't swum in the sea. But you're saying anyone can do it. And you must go with a buddy.

400
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,600
**Hong Min-ji**: Buddy system. Always. Anything can happen underwater. You could black out. Your buddy has to save you.

401
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:43,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: In that sense, it's a very safe sport. So you'll keep looking for places abroad? Pools are always the same. There, it's just about training to go deeper and hold your breath longer. You want to use that ability in the sea.

402
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,600
**Hong Min-ji**: Ultimately, we want to be natural sea divers, not just pool divers.

403
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: How is it different from the pool?

404
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:05,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: Meeting marine life, fish. And the sea has its own sound. Snap, pop, pop. It feels like the water is embracing me.

405
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Go to a hospital!

406
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: Really. It feels like the water is warmly hugging me. I feel like a fish.

407
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:41,800
**Hong Min-ji**: The scene keeps changing. Fish aren't always in the same place. I went to the East Sea recently. The weather wasn't great, so visibility was poor. But there were so many fish! Baby pufferfish! That's the joy of sea diving.

408
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Did you eat the pufferfish? No, the scenery changes. Are there major spots in Korea?

409
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: Ulleungdo is the best. So clear and clean. Visibility is great. Lots of fish.

410
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:19,000
**Oh Ye-seon**: It's great, but getting there is so hard. 3 hours on a boat, the seasickness is no joke.

411
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: I don't want to know about that. Ulleungdo is famous. Any others?

412
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,600
**Han Gyu-beom**: Janghohang, Gallamhang in Gangwon-do. Goseong, Ayajin, Songjiho.

413
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Clear water and lots of life. What about abroad?

414
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:48,600
**Hong Min-ji**: So many. I went to Saipan in August. Tinian Island. A 10-minute flight on a small plane. The water is 'Pong-ta' color.

415
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Pong-ta?

416
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
**Hong Min-ji**: The ice cream. Soda color. (Shows a photo)

417
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: I've never eaten that. Pass. (Laughter) Sky blue.

418
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,400
**Hong Min-ji**: Emerald green. It's beautiful.

419
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Like toilet bowl cleaner?

420
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
(Laughter)

421
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: You went there just for free diving.

422
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,400
**Hong Min-ji**: To feast my eyes. I only went with my boyfriend. He doesn't free dive.

423
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Then he's not a buddy.

424
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
**Hong Min-ji**: Right, so I only stayed in shallow water.

425
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: You broke the rule! Where's your buddy?

426
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
**Hong Min-ji**: Sorry.

427
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Why doesn't he learn? It'd be good to do it together.

428
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:56,400
**Hong Min-ji**: He's going to start next year. He felt helpless just staying on the surface while I was down there.

429
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Why next year? Do it now.

430
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,200
**Hong Min-ji**: He's doing tennis. It's not even that great of a sport!

431
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
(Laughter)

432
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: You'd want to do it together.

433
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: Soul buddy.

434
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Han Gyu-beom started because of another woman.

435
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: No, absolutely not.

436
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Think back. Those two women. Did they only wear bikinis? Anyway, what's your goal?

437
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:25,800
**Oh Ye-seon**: I started because of Ulleungdo, and after going there, I felt a bit empty. Like, "What now?" I've improved a lot, so I'm thinking of trying for an official record.

438
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:52,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Free diving makes you feel that. "Can I go deeper? Can I get a record?" The sense of accomplishment is big.

439
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:03,200
**Oh Ye-seon**: "I did it! Again!" It's addictive. No one thinks "I should enter a tournament" after a year of tennis or golf.

440
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: But this makes you think that way.

441
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,200
**Oh Ye-seon**: Many people come because of photos, but then they get serious.

442
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Hong Min-ji.

443
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:42,200
**Hong Min-ji**: I want to keep breaking my personal record. And keep it as a lifelong hobby. It's not a competition with others.

444
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: A competition with yourself.

445
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:11,200
**Hong Min-ji**: Tournaments are unique too. It's not just about winning. Even if someone only goes 10 meters, if they achieve what they said they would, they get a white card. It's very charming. Achieving that record gives you confidence in daily life.

446
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Park Min-joo hasn't reached that point yet.

447
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:27,200
**Park Min-joo**: I've only done 12 meters. I want to start AIDA 3 this year. And go abroad for fun diving next year.

448
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: You've been together for 7 years?

449
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
**Park Min-joo**: Yes.

450
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Time to break up. Kim Geun-ho, what about your girlfriend?

451
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,200
**Kim Geun-ho**: I don't have one. Don't ask.

452
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: Oh Ye-seon, what about your boyfriend?

453
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:53,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: He's not a fan. He tells me to only do it as long as it's not dangerous.

454
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Strange. Usually, people get curious and follow.

455
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: I like enjoying it alone. We've been together for 5 or 6 years. Time to break up.

456
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Hong Min-ji, you've known him a long time but only recently started dating.

457
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,000
**Hong Min-ji**: Those couples don't last long. (Laughter) Everyone is losing something here. I'm the only one staying the course.

458
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:37,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: It's portrayed as very romantic in movies. Don't do that too much. Han Gyu-beom, why is it good to do it together?

459
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:23,600
**Han Gyu-beom**: I need a long time to relax. Before going in, I need to lower my heart rate. It takes me a while. But when I'm with Min-joo, I feel more supported and relaxed than with other buddies.

460
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,600
**Park Min-joo**: Since it's always a buddy system, it's like going on a date.

461
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: But Oh Ye-seon doesn't want to.

462
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: I like it alone. Not disappointed at all. It's better. New opportunities arise. (Laughter)

463
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: Hong Min-ji saw him diving and wanted to learn. Do you want to learn together?

464
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,200
**Hong Min-ji**: We promised to get married. So he'll have to do it.

465
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: When did you promise?

466
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
**Hong Min-ji**: In Saipan.

467
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Cut that out. Was there a proposal?

468
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,200
**Hong Min-ji**: Yes. Is that too much TMI?

469
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: When is the wedding?

470
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
**Hong Min-ji**: Not set yet.

471
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:54,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: You have to do it to know. Let's finish up. None of you are athletes, none had special training, none were good swimmers. But after seeing someone do it, you jumped in. What do you want to say to people who are hesitant?

472
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:17,200
**Oh Ye-seon**: Just come. Try it once and see if it suits you. I'm telling everyone around me.

473
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,600
**Kim Eo-jun**: Some people get hooked after one try.

474
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,600
**Kim Geun-ho**: Right. Like I said, you find out quickly. Most people get hooked.

475
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:52,600
**Han Gyu-beom**: Just come to the water. It changes everything. No one who sees that beautiful sight can resist.

476
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,600
**Park Min-joo**: I'm trying to recruit everyone. I even pay for their experience dive!

477
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Why go that far?

478
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,400
**Park Min-joo**: It's so much fun, I want to share it.

479
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,400
**Kim Geun-ho**: I recommend it to everyone too. Not sure why.

480
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:40,400
**Hong Min-ji**: I only recommend it to those who really want to do it. It takes a lot of time. It's far, you have to pack a lot of gear. If you're going to do it, do it right. If you're hesitant, just don't do it.

481
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Cut that out too.

482
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:53,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: There's a brand called Cressi. Their YouTube ad is very fantasy-like. I send the link to everyone. "This is how you should dive."

483
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Lastly, the cost.

484
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: Initial cost is 100,000 won for an experience dive.

485
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,800
**Han Gyu-beom**: Usually 50,000 to 100,000 won.

486
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,000
**Hong Min-ji**: Up to level 3, excluding gear, it cost me about 1 million won.

487
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Less than I thought. What about pool fees?

488
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,600
**Oh Ye-seon**: 5-meter pool is about 20,000 won. 25,000 won. Some are 5,000 won.

489
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Deeper ones?

490
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:43,200
**Oh Ye-seon**: There are two. K-26 in Gapyeong and Deep Station in Yongin. Gapyeong is 33,000 won weekdays, 55,000 won weekends. Yongin is 44,000 won and 66,000 won.

491
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: That's the entrance fee.

492
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,200
**Oh Ye-seon**: For 3 hours. Instruction is separate.

493
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: So you pack your gear and drive there. Alone?

494
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,200
**Hong Min-ji**: I go with buddies from the center, or meet them there.

495
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: What does the buddy do while you're diving?

496
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,400
**Oh Ye-seon**: They watch from above. To see if you're okay.

497
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:30,800
**Kim Eo-jun**: They only watch that person. If you're going 30 meters, they follow you down to 20 meters. They come up with you because blackouts happen most often near the surface.

498
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:40,200
**Kim Eo-jun**: You have to save them if they lose consciousness. They're on standby, watching. When you come up, you make eye contact.

499
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,800
**Kim Geun-ho**: That's when sparks fly! (Laughter)

500
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:59,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: But it's hard to see their eyes. And it's a bit burdensome if they keep staring. I'm embarrassed to show my raw self.

501
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
**Kim Eo-jun**: Overcome that first!

502
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
**Kim Geun-ho**: Right.

503
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:16,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: But you come up making eye contact. "You're alive, I'm alive." Checking each other. Sparks could fly. It's romantic.

504
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,400
**Han Gyu-beom**: Actually, it's just awkward.

505
01:03:32,000 --> 01:04:00,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Maybe you didn't like her. (Laughter) Some people do fall in love. You have to give people some hope! This is a very charming sport. It's not as well-known in Korea, and the barrier to entry isn't that high. Anyone can do it. You can even date. That's the point of today's broadcast. Anyone can do it. Even Oh Ye-seon, me, Kim Geun-ho... Even Park Min-joo and Han Gyu-beom!

506
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
**Han Gyu-beom**: Soul buddy.

507
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,400
**Kim Eo-jun**: Don't say that. It's scary. Very dangerous. (Laughter) Thank you for being here today.

508
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
**Guests**: Thank you.

509
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
(Outro music)
