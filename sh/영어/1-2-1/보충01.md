Many people dislike the idea of being alone.
Society doesn't encourage it,
and most people find it difficult to imagine that there are those who truly enjoy solitude in fact,
being alone can even carry a sense of shame and isolation from one's community,
it seems that people consider it to be not a matter of choice, but the natural result of not being able to get along with other people in society.
Consequently, others may often assume that something is deeply wrong with a person who wants to be alone.

However, unlike this perceived sense of aloneness, being alone has its upside.
It can help you build a strong foundation for your personal development and growth.
When you are alone, the wall you have built to protect yourself fall down.
You have the liberty to think and make decisions for yourself without worrying about outside pressures.
Without alone time, it is quite easy for us to be influenced by our family and friends.
Although they may have the best intentions and you are welcome to take their advice, heir opinions may steer you away from what you truly want.
The more you learn to trust your inner voice, the closer you will be to the life that's best for you.
Like any skill learning how to be alone will take some time and effort.
This is a very normal reaction, so there's no need to worry.
It's probably because you've never practiced being alone before or you weren't often encouraged to self-reflect.
But once you start taking steps toward getting to know yourself on your own, you'll get used to it in no time.
Alter a while, fou may find yourself actually looking forward to your alone time!

Nothing is more difficult in this world than to read a book and then to express clearly and truly in a few lines exactly what the literary value of the book is.
Only a few great critics can do this, for the experience as well as the capacity required must be enormous.
Yet after all, the greatest of critics is the public, not the public of a day or a generation, but the public of centuries, the consensus of national opinion or of human opinion about a book that has been subjected to the awful test of time.
Reputations are made not by critics, but by the accumulation of human opinion through hundreds of years.

And human opinion is not sharply defined like the opinion of a trained critic;
it cannot explain;
it is vague,
like a great emotion of which we cannot exactly describe the nature;
it is based upon feeling rather than upon thinking;
it only says, "we like this."
Yet there is no judgment so sure as this kind of judgment, for it is the outcome of an enormous experience.
The test of a good book ought always to be the test which human opinion, working for generations applies.
And this is very simple.

The test of a great book is whether we want to read it only once or more than once.
Every additional time that we read a great book we find new meanings and new beauties in it.
A book that a person of education and good taste does not care to read more than once is very probably not worth much.
But we cannot consider the judgment of a single individual infallible.
The opinion that makes a book great must be the opinion of many because even the greatest critics are apt to have certain dullness or certain inappreciation.
We can doubt the judgment of the single critic at times.
But there is no doubt possible in regard to the judgment of generations.
Even if we cannot at once perceive anything good in a book which has been admired and praised for hundreds of years,
we may be sure that by trying, by studying it carefully, we shall at last be able to feel the reason of this admiration and praise.
The best of all libraries for a poor man would be a library entirely composed of such great works only, books which have passed the lest of time.
