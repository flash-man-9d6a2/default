Scientists today are able to accurately date fossils, the rock-bound remains of organisms from past geologic ages.
When fossils are arranged along a timeline, scientists can see gradual changes from simple to more complex life forms.
In some cases, evolution through various intermediate forms over millions of years can be detected and compared to the present state of an organism.
For example, the earliest known species of horse lived some 60 million years ago and, according to the fossil records, was shorter than 20 inches (50 centimeters) high at the shoulders.
Successive rock layers yield fossils of increasingly larger horse species, culminating in the horses of today.
As size changed, so did other aspects of the horses' anatomy: teeth became adapted to eating grass, the bones of the lower leg fused, and multiple toes evolved into a single toe surrounded by a hoof.

The future of the automobile industry is electric.
Every year electric cars are getting better and cheaper and every year more and more consumers are purchasing electric cars.
It is important to consider pros and cons when deciding if an electric vehicle (EV) is right for you.

It is said that one traditional gas-powered car rated at 22-miles per gallon emits an average of/4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.
Compare that with an electric vehicle, which emits no carbon dioxide.
Additionally, if the electric car is charged with renewable electricity, the carbon footprint will be even lower.

Electric vehicles are cheaper to fuel and maintain
These saving can add up quickly and come out to be around $632 per year.
These savings can be improved if you qualify for additional tax benefits.
Those who also install solar panels in their home may see even more Savings.

One of the benefits of owning an electric vehicle is the convenience of filling up at home.
This makes parking at home effectively the same as going to the gas station every day.
This advantage mostly applies to those who own their own home, or have access to a charging station where they live.

One thing gas has over electricity is how quickly you can refill the tank.
Filling up at a gas station takes two to three minutes.
Recharging an electric car can take hours to fully charge.
The time will vary on the model of the car.
Newer fast chargers are rated for a higher wattage and expected to charge up a battery to around 80% in about 30 minutes.

While it is true that all electric cars cost less to operate than their gas-powered cousins, the lower ongoing costs typically come at the tradeoff of a higher purchase price
The current price gap between equivalent models seems to be around $10,000, but this gap can continue to decrease as the technology matures.

"Just live in the moment!" say people who are selling something, probably.
New research, however, finds that this commandment is probably impossible thanks to the hard-wired ways our minds process thinking and decision-making.
The brain is tasked with keeping track of decisions and the outcomes they produce, as explained by the researchers in a study describing their work.
As we move through life, in any given moment we are constantly keeping past decisions in mind and weighing potential future ones.
Even if we're not consciously aware of it, we're always drawing upon past experience to inform our present actions.
The researchers summarized:
"Why aren't our thoughts independent of each other? Why don't we just live in the moment? For a healthy person, it's impossible to live in the moment.
It's a nice thing to say in terms of seizing the day and enjoying life, but our inner lives and experiences are much richer than that."

1 Our thoughts are interlinked vet also possess individuality.
2 Seizing the day and enjoying life are more valuable than dwelling on the past.
3 Our inner lives are filled with a wide range of experiences which help to simply live in the present
moment.
© The depth and complexity of our inner world can sometimes improve our ability to fully focus on our current lives.
• Our inner worlds are more than just a series of present moments, constantly influenced by past decisions and experiences.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations.
Believing that culture plays a role in human development, UNESCO has worked hard to protect World Heritage Sites, which have cultural, historical, scientific or other forms of significance.
UNESCO believes they belong to all of us rather than to any one nation, so they should be saved for future generations.
The Nubia Campaign was the UNESCO's first effort to conserve the world's heritage.
When Egypt planned to construct a dam on the Nile River, the dam would have flooded an important site from ancient Egyptian civilization.
The goal of the campaign was to relocate the Great Temple of Abu Simbel to a higher place and it worked.
Along with the success of the effort, several similar campaiens established the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in 1976.
Countries that have signed the World Heritage Convention can nominate sites to be considered for inclusion in UNESCO's World Heritage List.
Along with the site nomination, the site needs to have a management plan demonstrating how it will be protected.
UNESCO offers help putting the nomination together.
Once a site has been nominated and evaluated, it is up to the intergovernmental World Heritage Committee to make the final decision for addition to the World Heritage List.
The Committee is made up of 21 elected members, and they meet once a year to decide on new sites.

@UNESCO thinks World Heritage Sites beldng to the world not to each country.
UNESCO's initial work to safeguard the world's heritage was the Nubia Campaign.

The populations of Manhattan and Brooklyn surged, and the number of commuters between them was also increased.
Thousands of people took boats and ferries across the East River every day, but these forms of transport were unstable and frequently stopped by bad weather.
Many New Yorkers wanted to have a bridge directly connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn because it would make their commute quicker and safer.
Unfortunately, it was a very busy river at that time, with hundreds of ferries constantly cruising on it.
Any bridge over the river would need to be a very high suspension bridge.
Considering the limited technology in those days, building such a bridge seemed impossible.
That is, until John Roebling, an expert at building suspension bridges, accepted the challenge, people thought it was impossible.
John proposed the use of steel cables- instead of iron ones-that would be six times stronger than needed to support the bridge.
If his ideas worked, the result would be the longest, strongest suspension bridge ever built.
Prompted by John's ambition, many found inspiration, leading to the launch of construction in 1869.

The story of language is the story of human civilization.
Nowhere is civilization so perfectly mirrored as in speech.
If our knowledge of speech, or the speech itself, is not vet perfected, neither is civilization.
Language changes and evolves continuously, as are all human things.
Linguistics is the study of the laws governing the evolution of language.
Only when it sheds light upon the people speaking languages and their civilization does it become socially significant.
When this light is properly cast, linguistics ceases to be the dry-as-dust subject as many people have expected, and becomes the most absorbing field to pursue.
